 SUMMARY OF THIS PAGE
 -------------------
 ‚Ä¢ Shows live video from the iPhone‚Äôs front camera.
 ‚Ä¢ Extracts body pose from each camera frame using Vision.
 ‚Ä¢ Collects the last 60 frames of pose data.
 ‚Ä¢ Sends the frames into the Core ML model (Jumpingjacks.mlmodel).
 ‚Ä¢ Displays that Predictions > Output > Label as text on top of the live camera feed.

 In short:
 üëâ The page watches your movement and passes this information to the ML model to analyse


 HOW TO RUN THIS PAGE
 -------------------
 
DONE: (The 3 steps are done)
 1. Open this project in Xcode.
 2. Make sure `Jumpingjacks.mlmodel` is added to the project (drag it into the navigator if missing).
 3. Go to the app‚Äôs Info.plist and confirm:
      Privacy - Camera Usage Description = "Camera access is required to analyze jumping jacks"
 
 

 TO DO: (The below steps are not done because a real iphone is need to access the camera)
 4. Connect a real iPhone or iPad (‚ö†Ô∏è the Simulator does NOT support the camera).
 5. Select your device as the run target in Xcode.
 6. Press ‚ñ∂ Run.
 7. On the device, allow camera permission when asked.
 8. Stand in front of the camera and perform exercises.
 9. The prediction label will update live at the bottom of the screen.
